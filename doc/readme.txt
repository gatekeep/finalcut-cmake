----------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL CUT is a C++ class library and widget toolkit that enables
developers to create text-based user interfaces. It offers full mouse
support, UTF-8 character encoding, support for full-width characters,
and the capability to display combined Unicode characters. The library
helps the programmer to create an application for the text console. It
allows it to handle multiple text windows on the screen.

The design of FINAL CUT's C++ class structure was inspired by the Qt
framework. It offers a variety of general controls, including dialog
boxes, push buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, input lines,
list boxes, and status bars.
